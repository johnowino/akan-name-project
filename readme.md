## Description
{This application allows someone to derive their Akan names based on their gender and date of birth. It is based on an html file and is supported by css and javascript. All the user needs is aaccess to the web page with two pieces of information; their gender and date of birth. The application uses the date of birth to identify the day of the week the person was born. The day of week is then mapped to either a male or female array depended on the gender of the user. All the information is captured through a html form. Error control is limited by use of buttons for gender and use of in-built calendar for date. The form cannot be submitted without all fields completed }
